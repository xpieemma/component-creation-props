## Reflections

How did you handle optional props in your components?

- I usually used a boolean followed by "&&" and then the code that I wanted displayed conditionally.

What considerations did you make when designing the component interfaces?

- The interface needed to account for all possible properties and distinguish between the required properties and optional properties.

How did you ensure type safety across your components?

- Type safety was mostly handled by the interfaces and types that were created.

What challenges did you face when implementing component composition?

- Implementing components was pretty easy thanks to the example code provided in the lesson. It was a bit of a challenge using Tailwind to control the styling.
